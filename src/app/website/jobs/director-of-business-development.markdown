O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

Currency is as valuable as the economic activity it enables. Weâ€™re seeking an individual capable of orchestrating strategic deals, partnerships, and creative go-to-market strategies to engage with a wide variety of potential partners to help build liquidity and utility into the ecosystem.

Our director of business development will have the following responsibilities:

* Develop relationships with strategically important players, ranging from exchanges, merchants, and custody providers to nonprofits and governments
* Collaborate with product teams to develop and realize a vision for growing long-term economic value grounded in our protocol

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating problems that span finance, economics, computing, and business. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

The ideal candidate:

* Has deep experience in the cryptocurrency space and relationships with exchanges, custody providers, protocol developers, and other strategic players in the ecosystem
* Thoroughly understands blockchain and cryptocurrency technology
* Has proven ability to negotiate complex deals with a variety of senior stakeholders
* Is an excellent writer and persuasive speaker

There are no hard requirements and we're more interested in learning about your individual background.
