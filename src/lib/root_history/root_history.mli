type 'a t

(** This is a FIFO queue of values of type ['a], keyed by their length.
   Say [t : 'a t] has [max_size] [n], [l_old] is the length of the element
   with the smallest length, and [l_new] is the length of the element with
   the largest length.

   We maintain the invariant that [l_new - l_old <= n], dequeueing elements
   from the front of the queue if necessary after enqueueing elements.
