(** Module handling peer "trust" scores. Trust scores are initialized at 0,
    bounded between -1 and +1, increase when peers do good things, and decrease
    when they do bad things. If a peer's trust becomes <= -1, or takes an action
    that causes an instant ban, it gets banned. This module tracks, stores and
    updates trust, and notifies the rest of the system when a peer is banned. It
    does *not* specify specific things that cause trust to change, or how much,
    or actually do anything when a peer should be banned. That's the
    responsibility of the caller, which is coda_base. *)
