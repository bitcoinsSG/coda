(** Receipt_chain_database is a data structure that stores a client's
    payments and their corresponding receipt_chain_hash. A client
    uses this database to prove that they sent a payment by showing
    a verifier a Merkle list of their payment from their latest
    payment to the payment that they are trying to prove.

    Each account has a receipt_chain_hash field, which is a certificate
    of all the payments that an account has send. If an account has
    send payments p_n ... p_1 and h_n ... h_1 is the hash of the
    payload of these payments, then the receipt_chain_hash, $r_n$,
    is equal to the following:

    $$ r_n = H(h_n, H(h_{n - 1}, ...)) $$

    where H is the hash function that determines the receipt_chain_hash
    that takes as input the hash of a payment payload and it's
    preceding receipt_chain_hash.

    The key of the database is a receipt_chain_hash.
    The value of the database is the payment corresponding to the
    receipt_chain_hash *)
